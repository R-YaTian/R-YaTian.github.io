## Creating a NAND backup

1. Open the Flipnote Studio application
  - Ensure that the *booting to Calendar mode* is disabled in Flipnote Studio's settings
  - If you already have another DSiWare exploit installed, open that and skip to Step 12
  - Note that Sudokuhax *cannot* adequately make a backup with the required footer!
2. Select `View Flipnote` -> `SD Card`
3. Click on the lenny corresponding to your region (USA, JPN or EUR)
  - If you're on an AUS console, then select EUR
4. Select "Edit"
5. Click on the Flipnote frog icon in the bottom left
6. Click on the film roll icon
7. Select `Copy` -> `Back` -> `Exit`
8. Click the second note with a larger lenny face, and select "Edit"
9. Click on the Flipnote frog icon in the bottom left
10. Click on the film roll icon
11. Select `Paste`
  - This will launch HBMenu
12. Navigate to `fwTool.nds`, and press (A)
  - fwTool will appear
13. Navigate to `Backup DSi NAND`, and press (A)
  - This will take a few minutes
  - Store this NAND backup in a safe location, it is a critical backup and we will need it later to install HiyaCFW
  - When `saved nand.bin.sha1.` appears, the backup is finished
14. Navigate to `Exit`, press (A), and power off your system

## Installation
1. Insert your system's SD card into your computer
2. Copy `UNLAUNCH.DSI` from the Unlaunch `.zip` file to the root of your SD card
3. Rename `UNLAUNCH.DSI` to `unlaunch.nds`
4. Unplug your SD card, and insert it in your DSi
5. Power on your DSi, and repeat steps 1 through 11 in
[Creating a NAND backup](#creating-a-nand-backup)
  - HBMenu will appear
6. Navigate to `unlaunch.nds`, and press (A)
  - Unlaunch's installer will appear
7. Navigate to `INSTALL NOW` and press (A)
  - If Unlaunch freezes at `ERROR: MISMATCH IN FAT COPIES`, please read our [FAQ](/help/faq)
8. When done, navigate to `POWER DOWN` and press (A)
  - Your system will power off
9. Power on your system, to verify Unlaunch installed properly
  - You should now see Unlaunch's management screen

With Unlaunch installed, your system now has primitive brick protection, unless the launcher's TMD file is destroyed. Unlaunch has protections that should prevent this from happening, and HiyaCFW uses your SD card as the DSi's NAND, adding a very resilient layer of brick protection.
