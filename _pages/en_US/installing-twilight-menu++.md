## Usage

- To launch Gameboy Advance games, you'll need a copy of the GBA BIOS named `bios.bin` on the root of your SD card.
- You can place ROMs anywhere on the SD card.
- If you own a DSTWO, you can launch .plg files from the loader as well.
- You can pick between a Nintendo DSi theme, a Nintendo 3DS theme, a R4 theme and an akmenu theme.
- You can load sub-themes off the SD card. DS Homebrew contains repositories to host R4 themes, akmenu themes, DSi themes and 3DS themes.
- For DSi users, if you have Unlaunch and HiyaCFW, TWiLight Menu++ can completely replace your System Menu. This can help work around several bugs with SD card sizes and the DSiWare block limit.
- For flashcard users, if you have a compatible flashcard, you can make your flashcard autoboot into TWiLight Menu++.

## (DSi) Replacing the System Menu

You must have [Unlaunch](/guide/installing-unlaunch/) and [HiyaCFW](/guide/installing-hiyacfw/) installed before proceeding.

1. Power on your DSi while holding **SELECT**
2. If `Autoboot title` is not checked, navigate to it and press **A**
3. Press **START** to save and continue booting

TWiLight Menu++ is now your System Menu. If you want to run DSiWare, wait for steps on how to run them to appear.
